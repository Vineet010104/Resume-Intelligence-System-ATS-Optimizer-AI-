# 🧠 Resume Analyzer

**AI-driven Resume Intelligence Platform built with Spring Boot, FastAPI, and NLP — helping job seekers and recruiters bridge the hiring gap through intelligent resume–JD matching, skill extraction, and ATS optimization.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

Resume Analyzer intelligently parses resumes and job descriptions, extracts skills and roles using NLP, and computes a fit score based on embeddings and semantic similarity.  
The system enables job seekers to identify missing keywords, recruiters to shortlist efficiently, and developers to explore real-world microservice architecture with NLP integration.

This project demonstrates clean, modular, production-style design — blending Spring Boot (Java) for backend orchestration and FastAPI (Python) for the NLP/ML microservice — fully Dockerized for easy deployment.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

The **Resume Analyzer system** is designed using a modular **microservices architecture**, with clear separation of concerns between the application layer, ML/NLP engine, and data storage. Each component runs independently and communicates through REST APIs and is deployed using Docker for consistency across environments.

## Architecture Diagram

![Resume Analyzer Architecture](assets/resume-analyzer-architecture.png)

## **1. Spring Boot Application (`resume-analyzer-app`)**

This is the **core backend + UI** service.  
It provides REST APIs, authentication, business logic, dashboards, and the Thymeleaf-based user interface.

### **Key Responsibilities**

- **REST API Layer**  
  Handles résumé upload, JD upload, ATS scoring, keyword gap analysis, and analysis report generation.

- **UI Layer**  
  Built using Thymeleaf templates and Vanilla JavaScript for a clean, interactive UI experience.

- **Business Logic Orchestration**  
  Delegates all NLP-heavy processing to the ML Engine and merges the results into final ATS reports.

- **Authentication & Security**
  - JWT-based authentication  
  - BCrypt password hashing  
  - Secured endpoints with role-based access (User/Admin)  
  - Username/password login & signup  
  - Session management for secure interactions  

- **Guest Mode**
  - Allows users to try the analyzer without registration  
  - Sandboxed flow with restricted permissions  
  - Prevents write operations to user-specific database tables  
  - Ensures guest isolation for security  

- **Resume & JD Validation**
  - Resume section validation  
  - Basic rule-based extraction (experience, education, location)  
  - Client/server-side validations  

- **Activity Logging**
  - Tracks uploads, JD creation, analysis requests, and report downloads  

> **Note:** No ML or NLP computation is performed in the Spring Boot application.  
> All heavy processing is delegated to the Python ML Engine.

## **2. Python ML/NLP Engine (`resume-analyzer-engine`)**

A standalone **FastAPI microservice** dedicated to text processing, embeddings, feature extraction, and scoring.

### **NLP Capabilities**

- **Text Preprocessing**
  - Tokenization  
  - Part-of-speech tagging  
  - Lemmatization  

- **Entity & Skill Extraction**
  - SpaCy NER for detecting titles, skills, organizations, and qualifications  
  - Noun-chunking to derive role-specific keywords  
  - Custom dictionaries for technical and domain-specific skills  

- **Embeddings & Semantic Similarity**
  - Generates semantic embeddings using **MiniLM transformer models**  
  - Computes similarity using **cosine similarity (PyTorch)**  
  - Used for Resume ↔ JD alignment and score generation  

- **Keyword & Verb Extraction**
  - Action verbs and role-relevant verbs  
  - Highlights missing or low-frequency relevant keywords  

- **ATS Relevance Scoring**
  - Skill match ratio  
  - Title/role similarity  
  - Qualification and responsibility match  
  - Missing keyword detection  
  - Final Fit Score generation  

### **Service Characteristics**

- Stateless and horizontally scalable  
- Runs independently inside Docker  
- Exposes simple REST endpoints consumed by the Spring Boot app  

---

## **3. MySQL Database (`resume-analyzer-db`)**

The primary storage layer for the system.

### **Stores**

- User accounts (username, email, password hash, roles, etc)
- Uploaded resumes and extracted text
- Job descriptions
- ATS analysis results
- Recent activity logs
- Candidate → JD match history
- Optional guest session data (temporary)

### **Schema Characteristics**

- Normalized relational schema  
- Optimized for dashboard read performance  
- Strong referential integrity  
- Timestamp and audit fields for tracking changes  

---

## **4. Dockerized Deployment**

The entire system is containerized and orchestrated through **Docker Compose**, ensuring a reproducible and portable environment.

### **What Docker Provides**

- Independent containers for:
  - Spring Boot Application  
  - Python ML Engine  
  - MySQL Database  
- Bridge network for internal communication  
- Environment-variable-based configuration for secrets and URLs  
- Consistent deployment across local, testing, and cloud environments  

### **One-Command Startup**

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 🔄 Communication Flow

- The **Spring Boot backend** communicates with the **ML/NLP microservice** using `WebClient` over REST.
- The **ML Engine** performs all heavy text processing: NLP extraction, embedding generation, and similarity scoring.
- The processed results are returned to the Spring Boot service.
- The backend **stores the results** in the database and **exposes them to the UI** through REST endpoints and Thymeleaf views.
